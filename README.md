# Jamestodon

Is a fork of
[SplitShockVirus's fork](https://github.com/SplitShockVirus/mastodon) of
[glitch-soc](https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon), a fork of
[Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon), except that it's stuck on
v3.5.3 because I do not like the redesign for Mastodon v4. You may freely use
this fork however you want as it is licensed under the GNU AGPLv3.

I plan to use this fork for my experimental Mastodon instance just for myself.
